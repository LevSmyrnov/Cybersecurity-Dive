1. Home lab (Lab) is hosted on an ARM-based microcomputer Raspberry Pi.<br></br>
2. Lab is controlled from another machine via SSH, thus the host OS selection is headless (no GUI) "Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)" - OS with massive community support and beginner friendly, while being a bit more lightweight than standard GUI version. Version checked with ```cat /etc/os-release```.<img width="528" height="44" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f867e5-663b-4890-af77-5bb0425d9cb6" /><br></br>
3. During the installation, there was an issue with WiFi credentials pre-setup via image. In the end, wlan was set up manually, with attached display, via ```raspi-config```.<img width="779" height="349" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ebf1e86-0d11-4e29-bf2e-4101c1f0fe2f" /><br></br>
4. The important step is to set static IP for future administration. I have decided to set the required IPv4 manually on Lab via ```nmtui```.<img width="899" height="330" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed0ab0e0-3791-47fd-a77b-8a4d66b12755" /><br></br>
5. Then I wanted to have a diagnostics tool on Lab, so I installed Glances in Docker container with ```docker run -d --restart="always" -p <PORT>:<PORT> -e GLANCES_OPT="-w" -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro --pid host nicolargo/glances:latest-full```. The container is run in the background and starts automatically with home lab boot on web port \<PORT\> as web server. The next parameters allow for monitoring of all docker containers and Pi processes. Sample output from ```http://<LAB_STATIC_IP>:<PORT>```.<img width="922" height="683" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53a43f9d-31a7-44bb-923c-1df1f3b11cd0" />
